✒︎ Variable 👉🏻
    A variable in Python is a name that is used to store data values.
    It acts as a container for information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

    ✎ Rules of declaring variable :
        1. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
        2. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, not a number.
        3. Variable names are case sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are different).
        4. Do not use Python reserved keywords as variable names.
        5. Spaces are not allowed in variable names.


✒︎ Operators 👉🏻
    Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

    ✍︎ Types of Operators:

    ✦ Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, , **
    Example: a + b, a * b

    ✦ Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.
    Example: a = 5, a += 2
    
    ✦ Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    Example: a == b, a > b
    
    ✦ Logical Operators: and, or, not
    Example: a > 5 and b < 10
    
    ✦ Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
    Example: a & b, a << 2
    
    ✦ Membership Operators: in, not in
    Example: 'x' in list
    
    ✦ Identity Operators: is, is not
    Example: a is b, a is not b
